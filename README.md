Direct detection plots
======================

IPython notebook and .csv data files to create plots of dark matter direct detection bounds.
Each line is given its attributes individually, so even those who don't know matplot lib should
be able to styel the plots to their liking :)

The lines are digitised from data in the [2013 Snowmass report](http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.8327),
with the first results of [LUX](http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.8214) and [SuperCDMSadded](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/1402.7137)
to the spin independent plot.

The results look like this:
